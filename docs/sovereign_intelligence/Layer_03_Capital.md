# Layer 3: Capital & Growth (Funding & SEC)

## 💰 The Signal
Money is the ultimate intent signal. A company that just raised $50M (Crunchbase) or reported 40% YoY growth (SEC) is in a **buying frenzy**.

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **Venture Capitalists**: Find the "Hidden Gems" (Sovereign IDs) before they blow up.
2.  **Luxury Realtors/Cars**: Private founders who just had an "exit" or IPO filing.
3.  **Enterprise SaaS**: Companies that just secured funding need to spend it on HR, IT, and Marketing instantly.
