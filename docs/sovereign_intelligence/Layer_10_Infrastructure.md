# Layer 10: Deep Infrastructure (The Root)

## 🌐 The Signal
The literal servers a company runs. If they use **Cloudflare Enterprise**, they have a high security budget. If they run **AWS Lambda**, they are building serverless tech.

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **CyberSecurity Firms**: Find companies with open ports or outdated server headers (via Shodan records).
2.  **Cloud Migration Agencies**: Identify businesses still running on-prem legacy servers.
3.  **DevOps Recruiters**: Find companies using specific stacks (e.g. Kubernetes) to pitch specialized talent.
