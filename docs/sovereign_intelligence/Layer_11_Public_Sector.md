# Layer 11: Public Sector (The Government Hand)

## 🏛️ The Signal
Government contracts are guaranteed revenue. A company that just won a **$10M Defense Contract** is now an elite buyer.

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **Sub-Contractors**: Find the "Prime Contractors" who just won a big award and need partners.
2.  **Office Supply/Logistics**: Companies winning gov bids need physical offices and shipping fast.
3.  **Lobbying Groups**: Know who is winning the most influence in specific sectors.

## 💎 The "Omega" Advantage
Government data is public but **notoriously hard to navigate**. We distill the "Award Winner" into a "Sales Lead" instantly.
