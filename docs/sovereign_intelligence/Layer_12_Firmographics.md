# Layer 12: Global Firmographics (The Core)

## 🌍 The Signal
Standard business metrics at scale. HQ locations, employee counts, and corporate hierarchy.

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **Enterprise Sales Teams**: Mapping the "Account Hierarchy" for complex B2B deals.
2.  **Market Research Firms**: Analyzing "Total Addressable Market" (TAM) for specific regions.
3.  **Expansion Consultants**: Identifying cities with high densities of target industry employees.

## 🛠️ Profitable Search Patterns
- `site:linkedin.com/company "Tesla" employees worldwide`
- `site:crunchbase.com/organization "SpaceX" headquarters`
- `site:zoominfo.com/c "Amazon" revenue`

## 💎 The "Omega" Advantage
We use **Multiple Source-Triangulation**. We don't trust one directory; we verify employee counts across LinkedIn, Glassdoor (Layer 2), and SEC Filings (Layer 3).
