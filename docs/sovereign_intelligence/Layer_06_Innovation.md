## 💡 The Signal
Intellectual property. A patent filing for "Edge AI" means the company is investing in the future, not just maintenance.

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **Patent Attorneys**: Finding companies that need IP protection services.
2.  **DeepTech Investors**: Catching innovation spikes before they hit the news.
3.  **Suppliers**: If they patent a "New Drone Chassis," carbon-fiber suppliers need to call them.
