# Layer 2: Trust & Reputation (The Bouncer)

## ⭐ The Signal
Public sentiment and professional ranking. If a company is a "Clutch Leader" or has 100+ "G2 Reviews", they are high-trust and likely high-revenue.

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **Risk Management Firms**: Identifying brands with declining sentiment.
2.  **Influencer Agencies**: Finding high-rated brands to pitch collaborations.
3.  **M&A Brokers**: Quick reputation due-diligence for potential acquisitions.

## 🛠️ Profitable Search Patterns

## 💎 The "Omega" Advantage
We correlate **Reviews with Revenue**. A 5-star rating on Clutch + a $50k+ project minimum = A "Golden Lead".
