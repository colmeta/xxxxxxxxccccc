# Layer 5: Intent Signals (The Oracle)

## 🎯 The Signal
Active movement. If they are **Hiring an SEO Manager**, they need SEO tools. If they are **Spending $10k/mo on Ads**, they are in a "Scale Phase".

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **Recruitment Agencies**: "I see you're struggling to fill this Python Engineer role; we have candidates."
2.  **Ad-Tech Platforms**: Identify big spenders on Facebook/Google to pitch better ROI tracking.
3.  **B2B Vendors**: Hiring a "Head of Sales" = Demand for CRMs and lead lists.

## 🛠️ Profitable Search Patterns

## 💎 The "Omega" Advantage
