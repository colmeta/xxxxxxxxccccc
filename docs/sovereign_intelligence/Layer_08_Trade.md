# Layer 8: Trade & Logistics (The Gold Mine)

## 🚢 The Signal
Tracking **Bill of Lading** (BOL) records provides "Ground Truth" for physical business movement. If a company imports 50 containers of leather from Italy, they aren't just "in business"—they are scaling production.

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **Freight Forwarders**: Sell leads of companies importing high volumes of cargo.
2.  **Trade Finance Banks**: Find companies with large international transactions.
3.  **Supply Chain Consultants**: Identify businesses with inefficient or fragile supply routes.
4.  **Competitor Intelligence**: Tell Brand A exactly who the supplier of Brand B is.
