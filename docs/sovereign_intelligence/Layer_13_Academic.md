# Layer 13: Academic Frontier (The Future)

## 🧬 THE Signal
Scientific publication and depth. If a biotech firm is published on **Google Scholar** with 10+ papers on "mRNA Delivery," they are the global leaders in that niche.

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **Pharma / Biotech Investors**: Find the researchers behind the next breakthrough therapy.
2.  **Lab Supply Vendors**: Identify companies with active R&D publication cycles (they need equipment).
3.  **Headhunters for R&D**: Poaching the top academic talent from internal corporate labs.

## 🛠️ Profitable Search Patterns
- `site:scholar.google.com "AstraZeneca" research papers`
- `site:researchgate.net "BioNTech" publications`
- `site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov "Moderna" oncology`

## 💎 The "Omega" Advantage
This is the **Highest Frontier**. While others scrape the "Surface Web," we scrape the **"Knowledge Web."** You are selling the elite scientific mind of the industry.
