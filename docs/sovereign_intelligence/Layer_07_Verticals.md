# Layer 7: Vertical Sovereignty (Niche Mastery)

## 🏢 The Signal
Professional credentials and practice metrics. If a lawyer has 100+ Avvo reviews or a contractor has 20+ recent permits on BuildZoom, they are **Market Dominators**.

## 🎯 Target Customers (Who will buy this data?)
1.  **Lead Gen Agencies for Law/Med**: Sell high-intent lists of surgeons, dentists, and attorneys.
2.  **Product Manufacturers**: Dental supply companies need a list of high-volume dentists.
3.  **Real Estate Investors**: Finding active contractors via BuildZoom permit counts.
