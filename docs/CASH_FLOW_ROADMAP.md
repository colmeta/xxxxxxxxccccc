| **#4** | **ScraperAPI** | $49/mo | **Scale** | "Unlimited scraping without getting blocked" |

3.  **Client #3 Pays:** Buy **Apollo.io** ($49). *Now you sell full "Firmographic" profiles.*

**Give value first**, then let them buy.

### Step 1: The "Lead Magnet" (The Free Sample)
Run Pearl to scrape **100 perfect leads** for your target niche (e.g., "100 Roofers in Miami").
Clean them manually (add emails, check names). **Make this list PERFECT.**

### Step 2: The "Value Bomb" Cold Email
Send this to 50 Agency Owners.

**Subject:** 100 Roofers for [Agency Name] (Free List)
