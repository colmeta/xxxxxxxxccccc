# 💳 The Simple Payment Strategy: Getting Paid Worldwide

**Objective:** Set up a hassle-free system to accept one-time payments and recurring subscriptions globally.

## 🏆 Recommendation: Lemon Squeezy (Best for Data Sellers)
Why not Stripe directly? Stripe is great but requires complex coding for tax handling, invoicing, and subscription management. **Lemon Squeezy** acts as a "Merchant of Record" - they handle all the taxes, invoices, and global compliance for you.

*   **Cost:** Free to start (they take ~5% + 50¢ per transaction). No monthly fee.
*   **Best For:** Selling digital files (CSV lists) and subscriptions.
*   **Website:** [lemonsqueezy.com](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/)

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Your Products
Sign up and create two types of products in your dashboard:

#### **Product A: The One-Time List (High Ticket)**
*   **Name:** "7,500 Verified Roofing Leads - Florida Edition"
*   **Price:** $297 (One-time)
*   **File to Deliver:** The partial CSV (or a "Thank You" PDF with a link to the full Google Sheet).
*   **Why:** For clients who just want one specific dataset.

#### **Product B: The Monthly Subscription (Recurring Revenue)**
*   **Name:** "Agency Growth Plan - 2,000 Leads/Month"
*   **Price:** $499 / month (Subscription)
*   **Description:** "Freshly scraped leads delivered to your inbox every month."
*   **Why:** This is your **Cash Flow Engine**.
*   **Setting:** Enable "Subscription" mode. Set billing to "Monthly".

### 2. The "Checkout Link"
Lemon Squeezy gives you a direct link for each product.
*   **Example:** `checkout.page/buy/12345`
*   **Action:** Copy this link. You will paste this into your emails and DMs.

## 🚀 Alternative: Stripe Payment Links
If you already have a verified business Stripe account:
1.  Go to **Product Catalog** -> **Add Product**.
2.  Create your product.
3.  Click **"Create Payment Link"**.
4.  Send that link.
*   *Note:* Stripe is stricter. You need a registered business entity in many countries. Lemon Squeezy is easier for individuals/startups.

2.  Create a "Test Product" for $1.
3.  Send the link to yourself and buy it to see how smooth it is.
