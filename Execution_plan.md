## 1. THE TRIDENT STRATEGY
We are building one core capability (Unstoppable Data Acquisition) and selling it three ways:

### PRODUCT 1: DATAVAULT (SaaS) - **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**
*   **What:** Pre-built, verified datasets for specific industry solutions.
*   **Verticals:** B2B Sales, E-Commerce, Real Estate.
*   **Pricing:** $497 - $4,997 / mo.
> [!TIP]
> **Antigravity Note:** This is your primary cash-flow engine. Focus on B2B *Freshness* to kill Apollo.

### PRODUCT 2: DATAFORGE (Custom)
*   **What:** "You describe it, we scrape it." AI Agents building custom pipelines.
*   **Pricing:** $5k setup + usage.

### PRODUCT 3: TRAININGDATA.AI (Data Licensing)
*   **What:** Massive, raw datasets for training LLMs.
*   **Pricing:** $10k - $500k per dataset.

## 2. EXECUTION ROADMAP: PHASE 1 - "DATAVAULT VERTICAL" (Days 1-60)

### MONTH 1: The B2B "Truth Engine"
**Goal:** Beat Apollo on Accuracy.
*   **Week 1:**
    *   [ ] **[VERIFICATION FIRST]** Enhance `hydra_controller.py` with "Stealth Mode" (Residential Proxies).
    *   [ ] Build "The Arbiter": A module that cross-references LinkedIn + Company Website + Google News.
*   **Week 2:**
    *   [ ] Deploy `DATAVAULT Alpha`: A simple UI where users upload a CSV and we "clean" it.
    *   [ ] **Feature:** "The BS Detector" (Free tool to audit competitor lists).
*   **Week 3:**
    *   [ ] Scrape key datasets:
        *   "Top 50k SaaS Founders" (Verified).
        *   "E-commerce Owners in US" (Verified).
*   **Week 4:**
    *   [ ] **Launch B2B Vertical:** Outreach to cold email agencies with "Zero Bounce" guarantee.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Antigravity Risk Note:** If LinkedIn implements new fingerprinting, Hydra must pivot to Mobile Farm sourcing (Head 3) to remain "Unstoppable."

### MONTH 2: The E-Commerce "Hawk Eye"
**Goal:** Beat Price2Spy on Real-Time capabilities.
*   **Week 5:**
    *   [ ] Adapt Hydra for E-commerce (Product Page Parsing).
    *   [ ] **[AI EDGE]** Implement "Visual Pricing" (OCR/Vision API for images).
*   **Week 6:**
    *   [ ] Build the "Price War Room" Dashboard.
*   **Week 7:**
    *   [ ] Scrape initial index: "Top 100k Amazon Best Sellers" history.
*   **Week 8:**
    *   [ ] **Launch E-Commerce Vertical.**

## 4. "UNSTOPPABLE" TACTICS
1.  **Anti-Anti-Bot:** We rotate *everything*—IPs, fingerprints, and user-agent behaviors.
2.  **The "Human" Layer:** AI verification with human-in-the-loop fallback for 100% truth.
3.  **Low Cost:** **[CRITICAL]** Use your local PC as a worker to offset Render's free tier limitations.
