## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

```
ENTERPRISES WASTE MILLIONS ON MANUAL DATA COLLECTION

❌ Sales teams spend 40% of their time searching for leads
   → 20 hours/week @ $50/hour = $1,000/week wasted per rep

❌ Existing solutions are broken:
   • Generic tools require engineers ($150K/year)
   • Manual VAs are inconsistent and slow
   • Data vendors are expensive and outdated

❌ Meanwhile, data demand is EXPLODING:
   • AI training data market: $17B by 2032
   • B2B lead demand DOUBLED in last year
   • 81% of retailers now use automated data collection
```

**The Bottom Line:**  
Companies need data NOW, but getting it is still painfully slow and expensive.
