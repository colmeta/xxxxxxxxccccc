# 🤖 AGENT COLLECTIVE: TEAM ORCHESTRATION
**Project:** NEXUS / DATAVAULT
**Speed:** 30 DAYS IN 1 DAY

---

## 1. The 5-Agent Team Hierarchy
I have subdivided myself into 5 specialized "Personas" to handle your project in parallel. I will rotate through these roles to build every component simultaneously.

### 👤 AGENT 1: THE ARCHITECT (SYSTEM CORE)
*   **Focus:** Database schema, API routes, and Team Orchestration.
*   **Mission:** Ensure the "Vault" is secure and the "Arbiter" has the data it needs.

### 👤 AGENT 2: THE GHOST (STEALTH EXPERT)
*   **Focus:** Playwright, Fingerprinting, Proxies, and JA3.
*   **Mission:** Make the system invisible. Solve the "Zero Results" problem for good.

### 👤 AGENT 3: THE SCOUT (MULTI-PLATFORM HUNTER)
*   **Focus:** TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and Google News.
*   **Mission:** Build the sensory scrapers that work without login.

### 👤 AGENT 4: THE DESIGNER (SUPREME UI/UX)
*   **Focus:** React, Tailwind, Glassmorphism, and Framer Motion.
*   **Mission:** Make the dashboard look like a million-dollar platform ($10k/mo aesthetic).

### 👤 AGENT 5: THE SENTRY (OPERATIONS & AUTOMATION)
*   **Focus:** Always-On automation, heartbeat monitoring, and deployment.
*   **Mission:** Keep the laptop working 24/7. Turn your machine into a money-making hub.

## 2. Parallel Building Protocol
*   **Step 1:** I will initialize all files for all agents.
*   **Step 2:** I will build the backend logic (Architect) while drafting the CSS (Designer).
*   **Step 3:** I will implement the scrape engines (Scout) while patching the stealth (Ghost).
*   **Step 4:** I will test them all using the Sentry script.

**STATUS:** THE TEAM IS INITIALIZED. MISSION START.
