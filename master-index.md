## 💡 FOUNDER TIPS

### What I Wish I Knew Day One

1. **Start Talking to Customers Immediately**
   - Don't wait for perfect product
   - 50 conversations > 1000 hours coding

2. **Choose One Thing to Be World-Class At**
   - Can't be best at everything
   - We chose: Ease of use + AI-powered

3. **Build in Public**
   - Share progress on Twitter/LinkedIn
   - Creates accountability and builds audience

4. **Focus on Retention Over Acquisition**
   - Better to have 10 happy customers than 100 churning

5. **Talk to Investors Early**
   - Build relationships before you need money
   - Practice pitch 50+ times

6. **Hire Slowly, Fire Fast**
   - Every wrong hire costs 6 months
   - Culture fit is everything

7. **Obsess Over Metrics**
   - Track everything from day one
   - What gets measured gets improved

8. **Take Care of Yourself**
